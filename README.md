# CRTL

This is intended to be a basic and portable implementation of an ANSI C 
runtime library. The intent is not to provide 100% of the CRTL, rather 
the most commonly used C library functions.

This is primarily an educational exercise. You really come to understand 
the C library functions in a deep and meaningful way once you've actually
implemented them.

Development and testing will be mainly on Windows and MacOS, with Linux 
support also a goal.

At some point I also hope to use this with compilers that I write 
for microcontrollers.
