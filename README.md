# CRTL

This is intended to be a basic and portable implementation of an ANSI C 
runtime library. The is not to provide 100% of the CRTL, rather the
most commonly used functions.

This is primarily an educational exercise. Development and testing
will be mainly on Windows and MacOS, with Linux support added in the
future.

At some point I also hope to use this with a C compiler that I've written for microcontrollers.
